AI-Based Image Captioning System
This project uses deep learning techniques to generate descriptive captions for images. The system combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for generating captions based on the extracted features.
